## Intro  
![intro](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81706832/146065069-18dd020a-9c88-4853-8779-c89e42b7a531.jpg)  
Hello! my name is gyuwon-song.  
TThis is my blog I made through my school class.  
  
  
Below is my Instagram account, click [here](https://www.instagram.com/july.22days/) to access my Instagram account.

I usually post the photos that I think came out the best on Instagram.  
Instagram is like an album that collects only the highlights of my life.  
  
Below is my Naver Blog, click [here](https://blog.naver.com/o3ao_s2) to access my Naver Blog.

If Instagram is an album, Naver blog is like a diary.  
I think the biggest advantage is to be able to know what kind of day I spent and how I felt during the past days by recording my daily life every month.  
  
Below is my Facebook account, click [here](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100008277976591) to access my Facebook account.

In fact, I used Facebook a lot more when I was in high school than I am now.  
I rarely do it right now, and I use Instagram a lot more.

Right now, my GitHub is mainly used for school classes,  
but I hope it will be used for portfolios and other purposes over time :)!!  
  
  

## My Too Much Information  
I like all kinds of food, but I hate carrots very much.  
Usually people hate cucumbers and like carrots, but I'm the opposite.

I hate carrots!  
  
I am planned but lazy. I like to lie down and I'm very far from exercise.  
also I sleep a lot, so I can sleep up to 15 hours a day !!!  

My MBTI is ESFJ, and there is a saying that ESFJ is the most lazy among J.  
That seems to be correct. haha...  
.

Let's talk serious,  
I like to share my bright energy and positive impact with those around me.  
In addition, I aim for the positive emotional exchange felt when I am with the people I like.  
  
Even if you can't get a smile because of me, I live my life with a promise that I won't lose it.  
  
I aim for a life of love and being loved.
